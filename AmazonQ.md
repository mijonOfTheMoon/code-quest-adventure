# Code Quest Adventure - Amazon Q Implementation Notes

## Background Question Loading Implementation

To improve the user experience in the Code Quest Adventure game, I've implemented the following enhancements:

1. **Background Question Loading**:
   - Added a challenge cache system that preloads 8 questions in the background
   - Questions are loaded one by one to avoid overwhelming the server
   - The cache is checked before making API calls to reduce loading times
   - When the cache gets low (< 3 questions), more questions are automatically preloaded

2. **Improved Feedback Positioning and Animation**:
   - Moved the correct/incorrect feedback indicator to appear as a popup in front of the game engine
   - Added sophisticated animations:
     - Scale effect (grows from 80% to 100%)
     - Vertical slide animation
     - Fade-in and fade-out transitions
     - Delayed animation start for better visual impact
   - Enhanced visibility with better styling, shadows, and contrast
   - Positioned centrally for maximum visibility during gameplay
   - Used larger font sizes for better readability
   - Implemented smoother animations with cubic-bezier easing
   - Softened the colors for a more pleasant visual experience
   - Added blur effect and smoother rounded corners
   - Extended animation duration for a more elegant transition
   - Added proper animation sequencing for entrance and exit

3. **Hint System Improvements**:
   - Moved hints to the story container for better organization
   - Added horizontal slide and fade animation for hints
   - Improved the hint toggle functionality
   - Enhanced styling for better readability
   - Moved additional hints from feedback to the story container
   - Positioned hints at the bottom of the story container
   - Changed animation to slide from right to left

4. **Enhanced User Flow**:
   - Added a 4-second delay after submitting an answer before moving to the next question
   - Implemented proper animation sequencing:
     - Fade-in animation when showing feedback
     - Fade-out animation before moving to next question
   - Disabled the submit button during this period to prevent multiple submissions
   - Added a loading spinner when the next question is being fetched
   - Automatically transitions to the next question after feedback is shown

## Implementation Details

### API Service Enhancements
- Created a challenge cache system in `api.js`
- Added functions to manage the cache and check its status
- Implemented background loading with proper error handling

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added loading spinner component for visual feedback
- Implemented animated transitions for feedback and hints
- Improved state management for question transitions
- Added proper disabling of interactive elements during transitions

### Animation Details
- **Feedback Animation**: 
  - Combined scale, vertical slide, and fade effects
  - Used cubic-bezier easing for natural movement
  - Controlled via React state for proper sequencing
  - Separate animations for entrance and exit
- **Hint Animation**: Horizontal slide from right with fade-in effect
- Both animations use CSS transitions for smooth performance
- Timing is carefully calibrated for optimal user experience

### Performance Considerations
- Questions are loaded sequentially to prevent overwhelming the server
- Cache status is monitored to maintain optimal preloading
- Error handling ensures the game continues even if preloading fails
- Animations use CSS transforms for hardware acceleration

This implementation significantly improves the user experience by reducing wait times between questions while providing clear visual feedback throughout the gameplay.
